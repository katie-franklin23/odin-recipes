    <h3>The perfect after dinner treat</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>200 g quality dark chocolate , (70%)</li>
      <li>1 x 400 g tin of black pitted cherries in syrup</li>
      <li>200 ml double cream</li>
      <li>4 large free-range eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons golden caster sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering
        water, then remove to cool for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, simmer the cherries and their syrup in a non-stick frying pan
        on a medium heat until thick, then remove.
      </li>
      <li>Whip the cream to very soft peaks.</li>
      <li>
        Separate the eggs, add the yolks to the cream with the sugar, and whisk
        to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a pinch of sea salt to the whites and, with a clean whisk, beat
        until super-stiff.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold the cooled chocolate into the cream, then very gently fold that
        through the egg whites with a spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divvy up the mousse between six glasses or bowls, interspersing the
        cherries and syrup throughout, and finishing with a few nice cherries on
        top.
      </li>
    </ol>
