      <li>1 onion, diced</li>

      <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 (15-ounce) package whole milk ricotta</li>

      <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9×13 baking dish or coat
        with nonstick spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook lasagna noodles according
        to package instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add
        ground beef and onion and cook until beef has browned, about 3-5
        minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; season with salt
        and pepper, to taste. Drain excess fat. Stir in tomatoes and Italian
        seasoning until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella and egg; set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish; top
        with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup
        mozzarella cheese. Repeat with a second layer. Top with remaining
        noodles, tomato mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.*
      </li>
      <li>
        Place into oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until bubbling. Then
        broil for 2-3 minutes, or until top is browned in spots. Let cool 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
